### Project Proposal Template

#### Question/need:
* What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build? 
The framing goal is to develop a useful tool to allow people to plan stargazing nights! 
* Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
This is beneficial as a recreational tool to all those who love to stargaze!

#### Data Description:
* What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
The data I will use will include weather data and urban planning data.
* What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with? 
An individual sample of analysis will include a certain location and time frame. Within that location, the goal is to look at weather data, determine a good day for stargazing, and then to provide a good viewing location according to urban planning data I plan to pull from map databases.

#### Tools:
* How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project? 
I plan to use mongodb and python to work with my data and other visualization/webapp (flask) tools for the grander project.


#### MVP Goal:
* I would like to have a code taht is at least able to pull weather information for a given location to provide times within the next 10 days for stargazing.
